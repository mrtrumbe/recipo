A Recipe Repository

## About that food blog you have...

It probably isn't adding much to the world. Sure, you've got some good recipes gathered together. 
But are you saying anything unique? Are your pictures any good? Is there any reason for it
to exist beyond having a handy collection of your personal recipes?

When I asked myself these questions, my answer was a firm no. 

So I created this!

## About the Recipes Here.

I like these recipes and think they make good food. They were collected over many, many years 
from many, many sources. Most of them started as someone else's recipe which I adapted for
my tastes and with my own techniques or tweaks. A few are totally original. Most were sitting
in text files on old computers for ages, hand typed.

All this means attribution has been lost for all of them. This makes me sad. :( Going forward,
I will at least mention where I got the original idea or what recipe mine was based off of.

## Give me Recipes!

Got a recipe you think I should try? Submit a PR. If it looks good, I'll probably try it.
If it is good, I'll merge it.
