# High Protein Chicken Curry

## Chicken

* 3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts

Season with salt, pepper, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and optionally some garam masala. 
Let sit for 30 minute to absorb the salt. Add 1 tbsp of vegetable and mix to coat. Cook through on a grill 
or under a broiler. Let cool until you are able to handle it with your hands. Cut into 1/2” cubes and put into 
the fridge to chill completely through, at least 3 hours.

## Sauce

* 2 large yellow onions, roughly chopped
* 3 cups shredded cabbage
* 12 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
* 1 inch ginger, roughly chopped
* 1-3 jalepenos, roughly chopped (optional, choose your spiciness)
* 1 tbsp garam masala
* 1/2 tsp cardamom
* 1/4 tsp turmeric
* 8 tbsp tomato paste (about 3/4 of a 6 oz can)
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp black salt (optional)
* 2 tsp crushed methi leaves (optional)
* 2 cups cottage cheese (2% fat)
* 1 tsp kosher salt

In a large pot over medium heat, put 3 tbsp vegetable oil along with the onions and cabbage and a couple of 
generous pinches of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reduces and the onions are translucent, 
about 10 minutes. If using jalepenos, add them and cook for another 2 minutes. Add another 1 tbsp of vegetable oil 
along with the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Add the garam masala, cardamom, and 
turmeric and stir and cook until the spices are well cooked, another 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir to 
combine. Cook, stirring frequently, to cook off the raw flavor of the paste, about 3-4 minutes. Add 3 cups of cold 
water along with the paprika, black salt, methi leaves, and salt. Stir to combine.

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium high heat, stirring frequently. Reduce to a simmer (roughly medium low heat) 
and continue to cook until reduced to a slightly too loose sauce. Picture the sauce in a burrito. If it’s just a little 
too sloppy, you can stop cooking. Remove from heat and let cool about 10 minutes.

Put the sauce and the cottage cheese into a blender. Blend on high until it is completely smooth. You may need to add 
more water at this point to get it to blend properly. Add just barely enough to make it work. You want it relatively 
thick. Taste for salt. Now is a good time to adjust spiciness with some hot sauce if you’d like. 

Chill mixture in the fridge until completely cold, at least 3 hours.

## Assembly

* 24 medium-sized high fiber tortillas, [like these](https://www.missionfoods.com/products/carb-balance-soft-taco-flour-tortillas/)

Mix the chilled chicken and sauce together in a large bowl. If necessary, further chill to let the mixture set up and 
make it easier to work with.

Once cool, place 3oz of the chicken mixture on a tortilla then wrap it into a burrito shape. Repeat with the remaining 
mixture and tortillas. Put completed wraps on a parchment lined sheet tray and freeze them completely. Move to plastic 
bags or other freezer storage containers.

## Reheating 

Put wrap on a microwave safe plate and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Adjust as necessary for your microwave, but you 
are aiming for them to be completely thawed, but not completely warmed through. Move the wrap to a griddle over medium 
heat and brown on both sides. Careful! They are hot!
