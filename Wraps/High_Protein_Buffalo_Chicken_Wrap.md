# High Protein Buffalo Chicken Wrap


## Sauce

* 2 cups 2% cottage cheese
* 6-9 tbsp Louisiana-style hot sauce (adjust according to how spicy you like it)
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1 tbsp garlic powder, rehydrated with a little water
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1-3 cloves garlic (adjust according to how garlic spicy you like it)
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp black pepper

Put all the ingredients in a blender and blend on high until they are completely smooth.
Add water to the mixture as necessary to ensure it has enough liquid to blend. Taste for spice and salt levels
and adjust with salt and hot sauce as necessary.

## Chicken

* 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken breast
* kosher salt
* chili powder
* garlic powder
* black pepper

Lightly coat the chicken in kosher salt, then lightly coat in the spices. Set aside for 30 minutes to allow the salt to penetrate the meat.
Cook on a grill or under a broiler until cooked through. Set aside to cool enough to handle.

Cut chicken into 1/2 inch cubes.

## Assembly

* Sauce (see above)
* Chicken (see above)
* 5 oz low-fat blue cheese crumbles
* 5 oz part-skim shredded mozzarella
* 16 medium-sized high fiber tortillas, [like these](https://www.missionfoods.com/products/carb-balance-soft-taco-flour-tortillas/)

Mix the sauce, chicken, blue cheese, and mozzarella together thoroughly in a large bowl, cover it, then put it in the fridge to completely cool.
This makes it significantly easier to work with.

Once cool, place 3oz of the chicken mixture on a tortilla then wrap it into a burrito shape. Repeat with the remaining mixture and tortillas.
Put completed wraps on a parchment lined sheet tray and freeze them completely. Move to plastic bags or other freezer storage containers.

## Reheating

Put wrap on a microwave safe plate and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Adjust as necessary for your microwave, but you are aiming for them 
to be completely thawed, but not completely warmed through. Move the wrap to a griddle over medium heat and brown on both sides. Careful! They are hot!
