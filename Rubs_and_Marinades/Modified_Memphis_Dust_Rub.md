# Modified Memphis Dust

Builds off of [Meathead's Memphis Dust Rub](http://amazingribs.com/recipes/rubs_pastes_marinades_and_brines/meatheads_memphis_dust.html)
This rub adds mustard, Mexican oregano, and cumin for depth. 

For rosemary and Mexican oregano powders, grind whole leaves in a morter and
pestle or coffee grinder. Fresh toasted, whole cumin ground is best, but 
powdered works too.

1/3 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) American paprika
2 tablespoons cup garlic powder
1 tablespoons ground black pepper
1 tablespoons ground ginger powder
1 tablespoons onion powder
1 teaspoon rosemary powder 
1 teaspoon Mexican oregano powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon ground mustard powder
