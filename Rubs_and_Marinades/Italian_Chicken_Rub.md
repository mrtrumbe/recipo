Great for roasting, grilling, or smoking. As with all rubs, you should
salt your meat independent of the rub.

* 2 Tbsp Dried Oregano
* 2 Tsp Dried Thyme
* 2 Tsp Dried Marjoram
* 1 Tbsp coarsely ground Black Pepper
* 1 Tsp Onion Powder
* 1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder
* 2 Tsp Granulated Sugar (optional, to encourage browning)

Mix it up and store it in an airtight container until ready to use.
