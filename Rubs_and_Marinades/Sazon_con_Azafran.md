# Sazon con Azafran

Ingredients:

* 1 Tbsp ground cumin
* 1 Tbsp ground corriander
* 1 Tbsp ground anatto seeds (see substitution ideas below)
* 1 Tbsp garlic powder
* 1 Tbsp mexican oregano, crushed
* 1 Tsp ground black pepper

If you don't have anatto seeds, you can use 1-to-1 blend of paprika and turmeric. I also like to add some ground 
saffron strands for additional character.

Mix everything together.
