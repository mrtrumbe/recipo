# French Rub for Chicken

Great for roasting, grilling, or smoking. As with all rubs, you should
salt your meat independent of the rub.

Ingredients:

* 3 Tbsp coarsely ground Herbs de Provence
* 1 Tbsp coarsely ground Black Pepper
* 1 Tsp Onion Powder
* 1/2 Tsp Garlic Powder
* 2 Tsp Granulated Sugar (optional, to encourage browning)

If you can't find Herbs de Provence, you can use a blend of Thyme, Marjoram,
Rosemary, Savory, Tarragon, and Fennel Seed. Or whichever of those you have on
hand.

Mix it up and store it in an airtight container until ready to use.
