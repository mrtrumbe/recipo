# Alkaline Noodles

## Ingredients

* 15 1/2 oz - All Purpose Flour (about 3 1/2 cups)
* 4 tsp - Baked Baking Soda
* 8 oz - Luke Warm Water (just under 1 cup)


## Baked Baking Soda

_\[This makes more baked baking soda than you need for these noodles. Store left-over baked baking soda in an air-tight container.\]_

Preheat an oven to 250F. Place 1/2 cup Baking Soda (check the expiration!) on a
baking sheet and spread out evenly. Place baking sheet on a middle rack of your
oven and bake for 1 hour.

Remove from oven, let cool completely and store in an air-tight container.


## Noodle Dough

This dough is quite dry and mixers have a very hard time with it. I recommend
doing it by hand, though you’ll get quite a workout!

In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the baked baking soda in the water. Add the
flour a bit at a time, mixing with a wooden spoon, until a dry dough forms. At
some point, you’ll want to turn the dough out onto a clean kneading surface to
finish mixing and forming by hand.

_\[After a couple times making this recipe, you’ll get a feel for what the consistency of the dough should be (almost too-dry but wet enough to form a cohesive ball). You can add more flour or water to get the right consistency (a tiny bit at a time) in this first phase of mixing.\]_

After a consistent dough ball is formed, knead by hand for 5 minutes. Form the
dough into a round ball and wrap in plastic wrap. Let rest on the counter for
20 minutes. Unwrap the dough and knead by hand for another 5 minutes.

Form the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic and then put it in the refrigerator
to cool.  Cool for at least an hour and up to a day. Before making the noodles,
take the dough out of the refrigerator and let rest on the counter for 20 minutes.

Divide the dough into six portions. Using a pasta roller, roll each portion out
into a flat sheet. Thickness is up to you, but I like them quite thick
(the second thickest setting on my pasta machine). Then cut the noodles, either
by hand or using your pasta machine’s cutting settings. Again, thickness is up
to you, but I prefer them on the thick side.

During the rolling and cutting process, keep the noodles well-floured to prevent
sticking and to get clean cuts. Make sure there is a little flour on the finished
noodles to prevent sticking.

## Boiling the Noodles

Use way more water than you think you’ll need. I use my biggest pot, filled 3/4
of the way.

Also prepare a large cold water broth. Use ice to ensure the water is cool enough
to cool down the noodles quickly.

Bring the water to a vigorous boil before adding the noodles. Cook them only 2-3
minutes, checking doneness to make sure you don’t overcook them. When done, use
a fine strainer or large spoon with holes to remove them quickly from the hot water
and immediately place them in the cold water bath. Cool completely and wash off
any starch, then move the noodles to a separate bowl.
