# Pasta Carbonara

## Legal Disclaimers

Timing in this recipe is the key to its success, so read through the recipe before you
try it, then follow the steps exactly.  You need everything to be the right
temperature at exactly the right time.

You'll need a really large pot, a large frying pan and a bowl that is good at retaining
heat (I use a large glass bowl).

Finally, this recipe does not double or triple well.  Small batches are the only way to
go.



## Ingredients

* 12 oz. pasta (about 3/4 of a normal sized box; spaghetti is traditional, stick with
    something long and thin)
* 1 egg and 2 additional egg yolks
* 4 oz. pancetta, cut into lardons (if you can find guanciale, use that; bacon works
    in a pinch)
* 2 oz. Pecorino Romano cheese (Parmigiano-Reggiano makes a fine substitute)
* Coarsely ground black pepper


## The Steps. Exactly.

1. In a small bowl, thoroughly mix eggs and leave out to reach room temperature.

2. Grate the cheese and leave out to reach room temperature.

3. Fill a large pot with water and put over high heat.  You should only lightly salt
the pasta water, or don't salt it at all if your palette is sensitive to salt.  The
meat and cheese will provide nearly all of the saltiness of the dish.

4. While the water is coming to a boil, put a large frying pan over medium heat and
add the meat.  Cook until most of the fat has rendered and the meat is slightly
crispy.  You aren't shooting for super crispy and deep brown here.  Shut off the
heat and remove the meat from the pan, leaving the fat.

5. When the water is boiling vigorously, add the pasta and stir to prevent sticking.

6. While the pasta is boiling, fill your large bowl with piping hot tap water to
warm it.

7. When the pasta is almost al dente, reserve two cups of the boiling water in a
easy to pour bowl.  Turn the heat on the frying pan to medium high to get the fat hot.

8. Drain the pasta.  DO NOT RINSE!

9. Add the pasta to the hot fat in the frying pan and stir well to cover the pasta.
If the pasta sticks, use some of the reserved water to loosen it. If you do add
water, let some of it boil off before proceeding. Shut off heat.

10. Empty large bowl of water and add eggs to the bowl. Beat eggs again to loosen.

11. Add 1/3 of hot pasta to the bowl. Keep the pasta and eggs moving as you add the
pasta to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Add 1/3 of the cheese and a couple good
pinches of black pepper and work into the pasta and egg mixture.

12. Add the remaining hot pasta and half of the remaining cheese.  Again, keep the
mixture moving to prevent scrambling.

13. This step is crucial.  Add just the right amount of reserved pasta water to
achieve the desired consistency.  You want the mixture to be just a tiny bit looser
in the bowl than you want it when you serve it.  As the pasta cools, even just a tiny
bit, it will thicken.  Add the water in small amounts, thoroughly incorporating the
water before adding more.  You are looking for a smooth, creamy texture.

14. Add the remaining cheese and rendered meat and incorporate thoroughly.  Taste
sauce and finish with black pepper and, if necessary, a pinch of salt.

15. Warm the serving bowl under piping hot tap water and serve IMMEDIATELY. This is
a dish that doesn't look good after even 10-20 minutes and tastes best immediately.
Serve with grated cheese and black pepper.



## "But I'm not a purist!"

I hear you. I personally like adding a bit of shaved garlic to the pan when re-heating
the fat.

Sometimes, I like to garnish with a bit of finely chopped chive or parsley.

I've even worked in some chopped sun-dried tomatoes when working in the meat. HORROR!

But sometimes breaking with tradition tastes pretty good.
