# Halal Cart Chicken

This recipe is great to make ahead. You can marinade and cook off the meat before 
you want to use it. Store it in the fridge, then fry up a batch when you want it.

Serve with [golden rice](../Rice/Golden_Rice.md), 
[halal cart sauce](../Sauces/Halal_Cart_Sauce.md), lettuce, and tomato.

## Ingredients

* Juice of one lemon
* Leaves from two sprigs of oregano
* Leaves from 5 sprigs of parsley
* 5 cloves of garlic
* 1 Tsp of ground corriander
* 2 Tsp of [Halal Cart Spice Mix](../Rubs_and_Marinades/Halal_Cart_Spice_Mix.md)
* 1 Tbsp kosher salt
* 3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 3 Pounds Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs

## Instructions

Put all of the ingredients except the chicken in a blender, small food processor, 
coffee grinder, or mortar and pestle and blend until it turns into a smooth liquid.

Trim the chicken of any excess fat. Put the chicken and the spice/lemon mixture into 
a plastic bag and marinate for at least an hour, but no more than 4 hours. Excessive 
marinading in an acidic marinade will turn the chicken mushy. 

Remove the chicken from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. In a large 
frying pan, heat 1 Tbsp neutral oil over medium high heat. Add the chicken thighs, 
but do not over crowd the pan. Do multiple batches if necessary.

Cook the chicken over medium high heat until brown on the initial side. Reduce heat 
to medium and flip the chicken. Cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the chicken 
is cooked through.

Remove the chicken from the pan and cut into small chunks. Repeat with a second 
batch if necessary. Put the chicken into an air tight container in the refrigerator 
until ready to eat. 

To serve, put a frying pan over medium high heat. Add a tablespoon of extra virgin 
olive oil. Add chicken, a couple of pinches of salt, and a couple of pinches of 
spice mix. Cook until heated through, using a spatula to scrape up the chicken to 
avoid sticking. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice.
