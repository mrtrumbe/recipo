# Chicken Chermoula

Chermoula is an herb sauce used in Moroccan cuisine, often with seafood. Here it's used with grilled chicken, which also works well.

## Ingredients

* 2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs                    
* 2 yellow onions, halved then sliced
* Chopped/smashed pistachio kernels, for garnish
* Fresh cilantro, for garnish

For the chermoula:

* 1 cup cilantro, can include stems (it all gets blended up)
* 2 tablespoons paprika
* 1 tablespoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, crumbled
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon water
* juice of 1 lemon


## Instructions

Combine all the ingredients for the chermoula and process in a blender or food processor until it forms a smooth paste. I recommend setting aside maybe 1/5th of the chermoula to serve with the finished chicken.

Pour the non-set-aside chermoula in a ziploc plastic bag or glass bowl/container with a lid. Add the chicken and turn to coat in the sauce. Seal and place in fridge, marinate for 2+ hours.

Grill the chicken thighs. When done, put them on a plate and cover loosely with foil to let rest briefly.

While the chicken rests, throw the onions on the grill and cook for just a few minutes, turning once.

To serve, top the chicken with the onions, pistachio bits, and some fresh cilantro. Pass around the reserved chermoula sauce, if you have any.
