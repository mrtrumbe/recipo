# Braised Brisket

Start this a day in advance for best results (to properly salt the meat).

This recipe is intended for the flat portion of a whole packer brisket. This 
is the brisket most often available at the supermarket, but make sure you don't 
buy a whole packer brisket or just the tip portion of the brisket.

You'll also need a cooking vessel that can go over direct heat (to sear the
brisket), then hold the entire brisket and go into the oven (covered, for 
braising). If you have a roasting pan that can go over direct heat, that will
likely work. Just use tin foil over the top of the roasting pan to improvise
a braising pan. You can even use two different pans, if necessary: just sear
the brisket in one pan, then transfer everything to a braising pan when it
comes time to move to the oven.

## Ingredients

* 1 beef brisket flat, 4-6 pounds
* Kosher salt (see recipe for quantity)
* 2 tsp vegetable oil

* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 2 large yellow onions, chopped
* 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 5 cloves garlic, crushed
* 2 bay leaves broken into pieces
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme leaves
* 10 black peppercorns
* 2 whole cloves
* lime peel (about 2 square inches)
* 5 szechuan peppercorns (optional)
* 5 juniper berries (optional)
* 1/2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 can tomato sauce, 8 oz.
* 1/2 cup white wine
* 2 cups chicken stock
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp lime juice

## Instructions

To prep the brisket, rinse it under cold water, then trim any membranes or dry
patches from the surface using a sharp knife. Trim excess fat from the brisket, 
leaving only about 1/4 inch of fat. Finally salt the brisket, using 1/2 tsp of
kosher salt per pound of meat. Wrap the brisket tightly and let sit in the fridge
for at least an hour, preferably 24-48 hours.

When the brisket is ready, preheat oven to 300˚F.

Put your pan over high heat and wait for it to get scorching hot. Add the 
vegetable oil (it'll start smoking), coat the pan with it, then add the brisket, 
fat side down. Allow the brisket to sear, pushing down to ensure it is making 
contact with the pan if necessary. When the fat side is a deep, dark brown, flip 
the brisket. Again sear until a deep brown. Remove the brisket and set aside.

Turn the heat down to medium-high. Add the additional vegetable oil, the chopped 
onion, and 1/2 tsp of the kosher salt. Fry the onions until brown and translucent.
Add the garlic, bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns, cloves, lime peel, szechuan
peppercorns, juniper berries, and tomato paste. Fry and stir until fragrant, about
1-2 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and stir and fry until most of the liquid is
gone, about 3-5 minutes. Add the white wine and scrape the pan, getting any bits 
unstuck from the bottom and sides of the pan. Add the chicken stock and soy sauce
and stir thoroughly, then bring the mixture back to a vigorous simmer. Shut off 
the heat and add vanilla extract and lime juice.

Add the brisket back to the pan (or move the brisket and liquid to a new pan), 
cover the pan, then put the pan in the 300˚F oven. Let the brisket braise for
about 40 minutes per pound of meat. You can also set the over a bit higher and
the brisket will be done faster. I've tried up to 325˚F with good results. When 
the brisket is fork tender, remove the brisket from the braising pan and
wrap in 2 layers of foil. Let rest 30 minutes to an hour. 

While the brisket is resting, put the remaining liquids and solids through a fine 
metal sieve, pushing through as much onion and garlic as possible. Put the sieved 
liquid into a sauce pan over low-medium heat until simmering gently. If the sauce 
isn't thick enough for your liking, thicken with a small amount of roux or a 
water and corn starch slurry. The sauce shouldn't be as thick as a gravy, but
just thick enough to stick to the meat a bit.

Slice the brisket against the grain (the brisket will be impossibly tough and dry
if you slice it with the grain and have long strands of meat) with a very sharp 
knife, making slices about 1/8" to 1/4" thick. Put in a deep-sided serving dish,
then pour about 1/2 of the sauce, piping hot, over the brisket. Keep the dish 
warm until ready to serve. Serve with the sauce.
