# Braised Brisket

Start this a day in advance for best results (to properly salt the meat).

This recipe is intended for the flat portion of a whole packer brisket. This 
is the brisket most often available at the supermarket, but make sure you don't 
buy a whole packer brisket or just the tip portion of the brisket.

You'll also need a cooking vessel that can go over direct heat (to sear the
brisket), then hold the entire brisket and go into the oven (covered, for 
braising). If you have a roasting pan that can go over direct heat, that will
likely work. Just use tin foil over the top of the roasting pan to improvise
a braising pan. You can even use two different pans, if necessary: just sear
the brisket in one pan, then transfer everything to a braising pan when it
comes time to move to the oven.

## Ingredients

For brisket prep:

* 1 beef brisket flat, 4-6 pounds
* Kosher salt (see recipe for quantity)

For sauce:

* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 large yellow onions, chopped
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 5 cloves garlic, crushed
* 2 bay leaves broken into pieces
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme leaves
* 1/2 tsp dried rosemary leaves
* 10 black peppercorns
* 8 whole cloves
* lime peel (about 1" by 2")
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 5 juniper berries (optional)
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 cup white wine
* 1 cup chicken stock or water
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tbsp dark brown sugar
* 1 package unflavored geletin sprinkled over 1/4 cup of cold water
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tbsp lime juice

## Brisket Prep

The brisket can be prepped up to 2 days in advance and should be prepped
at least an hour in advance. The salting process makes for a more tender
and juicy brisket.

If it appears to need it, rinse the brisket under cold water. Trim any membranes 
or dry patches from the surface using a sharp knife. Trim excess fat from the 
brisket, leaving only about 1/4 inch of fat. Finally thoroughly salt the brisket, 
using 1/2 tsp of kosher salt per pound of meat. Wrap the brisket tightly and let 
sit in the fridge.

## Braising Liquid Prep

The braising liquid can also be prepped up to two days in advance.

The first step is to "brown fry" your onions. Put a saucepan over medium high 
heat, add 2 tbsp of oil, then add the chopped onion, 1 tsp of salt, and 
1/4 tsp baking soda. Fry the onion, stirring occasionally, until they start 
forming deep brown spots. Before the onions start to burn, add 1/2 a cup of water 
(preferably heated) and stir vigorously to loosen any brown bits from the pan. 
Continue cooking until the liquid boils off and the onions begin to fry again. 
Continue to fry them until they start to form new deep brown spots, then add 
1/2 cup of water and repeat the process. Do this procedure 2-4 times to turn
the onions a deep, dark brown. You are aiming for the mixture to be a little 
lighter than the color of french onion soup.

After you get the onions to the desired color, again add 1/2 cup of water and 
cook the liquid down until the onions just start frying. Then turn the heat down 
to medium and immediately add the garlic cloves, bay leaves, thyme leaves, 
rosemary leaves, black peppercorns, cloves, lime peel, paprika and juniper 
berries. Stir and fry until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, mix it
in and fry until raw tomato flavor is gone, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup white 
wine, chicken stock, soy sauce, dark brown sugar, and geletin. Bring mixture to 
a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn the heat 
of and set aside. If you aren't cooking the brisket until the next day, put the 
mixture in an air tight container in the fridge.

## Cooking the Brisket

Preheat oven to 300˚F.

Put your braising pan over high heat and wait for it to get scorching hot. Coat 
the brisket in vegetable oil, then add the brisket, fat side down, to the pan. 
Allow the brisket to sear, pushing down to ensure it is making contact with the 
pan if necessary. When the fat side is a deep, dark brown, flip the brisket. 
Again sear until a deep brown. Remove the brisket and set aside. Add the remaining 
1/2 cup of white wine to the pan and deglaze the pan. Add the prepared braising
liquid to the braising pan, mix everything well, and bring to a strong simmer.
Turn off heat.

Add the brisket back to the pan (or move the brisket and liquid to a new pan), 
cover the pan, then put the pan in the 300˚F oven. Let the brisket braise for
about 40 minutes per pound of meat. You can also set the oven temperature a bit 
higher and the brisket will be done faster. I've tried up to 325˚F with good 
results. When a fork can slip into the meat without much force, remove the brisket 
from the braising pan and wrap in 2 layers of foil. Let rest 30 minutes. 

While the brisket is resting, put the remaining liquids and solids through a fine 
metal sieve, pushing through as much onion and garlic as possible. Put the sieved 
liquid into a sauce pan over low-medium heat until simmering gently. If the sauce 
isn't thick enough for your liking, thicken with a small amount of roux (see below)
or a water and corn starch slurry. The sauce shouldn't be as thick as a gravy, but
just thick enough to stick to the meat a bit. Stir in the vanilla extract and lime
juice. Taste, then season with additional salt, fresh ground pepper, dark brown 
sugar, and balsamic vinegar if necessary.

Slice the brisket against the grain with a very sharp knife, making slices about 
1/8" to 1/4" thick. **The brisket will be impossibly tough and dry if you slice it 
with the grain and have long strands of meat.** Put the sliced brisket in a 
deep-sided serving dish, then pour about 1/2 of the sauce, piping hot, over 
the top. Wrap with foil, and let sit for at least 30 minutes, or up to a couple of 
hours. Keep the dish warm until ready to serve. Serve with the sauce on the side.

## Thickening with a Roux

When I make this recipe, I almost always thicken it with a roux. The sauce is a bit
watery on its own, and nothing beats the silkiness a roux imparts to a sauce. The 
more roux you make, the thicker the sauce will be. I usually aim for a roux with 
2-4 tablespoons of flour in it. Any more than that and you are making a gravy.

Use equal parts butter and flour.

Put the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat and wait for the butter to
melt and the bubbling of the butter to slow down. Next add the flour and
immediately whisk it in until well combined. Smell the mixture. You should
smell raw flour. Continue to cook and whisk just until that raw flour smell
is replaced by a slightly nutty smell. Remove from heat. Your roux is ready
to use.

You'll want to combine the roux and the liquid carefully to avoid a broken
sauce. You have three options:

* have the roux hot and the liquid cool
* have the roux cool and the liquid hot
* have both the roux and the liquid warm

Whichever you choose, be sure to incorporate the liquid slowly, about a cup
at a time. Add the liquid, whisk in thoroughly, then put over medium-high
heat and whisk until the liquid simmers and thickens. Repeat until all of
the liquid is incorporated (it'll get less thick between each addition of
liquid). Gently simmer the liquid for at least 5 minutes after the last 
addition.
