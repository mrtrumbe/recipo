# Roast Chicken with Dressing

A whole chicken, roasted in pieces, over a flavorful bread dressing. The chicken
is simply salted and herbed. There are two directions I like to take with the 
dressing:

* A crunchy, chewy, traditional bread dressing that has mushrooms and leeks in 
it.
* A "bread salad" with lightly wilted greens and crunchy, chewy cubes of
dressing in it.

The methods are very similar and both are covered below.

## Ingredients

For the roast chicken:

* 1 whole chicken (preferably a roaster) cut into pieces. Cut breasts in half.
* 1/5 tsp of kosher salt per pound of chicken
* An herb rub. Maybe [this one](../Rubs_and_Marinades/French_Chicken_Rub.md)? Or 
[this one](../Rubs_and_Marinades/Italian_Chicken_Rub.md)?

For the dressing:

* 1 loaf of crusty, chewy bread (italian or french loafs work well, baguettes
are a good second choice)
* 4 Cups of low sodium chicken broth
* 2 Cups of a bright white wine (like a Sauvignon Blanc)
* 1 sprig of thyme
* 1 bay leaf
* 6 whole black peppercorns
* 3 whole cloves of garlic
* 1 carrot
* 1 packet of gelatin powder (optional, but recommended)

For the traditional dressing:

* 2 Tsp oil
* 1 1/2 pounds of mushrooms (brown button and shitake work well, but any will do)
* 8 Tbsp of butter
* 2 large Leeks, cut and thoroughly soaked and rinsed to remove grit
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 whole sprig of thyme or sage
* 2 egg yolks from large eggs
* 1 Tsp granulated sugar
* salt and pepper to taste

For the bread salad:
* 4 Tbsp of butter
* 4 Tbsp of extra virgin olive oil
* 2 large shallots, minced
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 sprig of Thyme and/or Tarragon
* 1/3 cup of bright white wine (like a Sauvignon Blanc)
* 4-6 cups of frisee (arugala also works)
* 1/2 cup of toasted pine nuts
* 1/4 cup of capers (or pickled onions/shallot/etc)
* 1/4 cup of fresh tarragon, plucked from the stems but not cut
* Fresh lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil to dress
* salt and pepper to taste


## Pre-Roast Instructions

Prep the chicken at least an hour in advance or up to a day in advance. Evenly
coat the chicken in the kosher salt, then generously apply rub, using up to 4 
Tbsp to taste. Let the chicken sit in the refrigerator until ready to roast.

Put the broth, white wine, thyme, bay leaf, peppercorns, cloves of garlic,
carrot and gelatin powder into a large sauce pan. Bring to a soft boil over high
heat, then turn heat down and continue to gently simmer. Reduce to about 4 cups 
total. Strain the liquid and set aside.

While the liquid is reducing, cut the bread into 3/4" slices, then gently rip 
into 1" pieces. The pieces will be irregular and that's ok. Place on a single 
layer on 1 or 2 baking sheets then place into a 275F oven. Turn bread every 
20 minutes or so and cook until the bread is nearly completely dry. You don't 
want to completely dry out the bread, but come close. Totally dry bread makes
the end product less chewy, so dry to your desired level of chewyness. Remove 
the bread from the pan and let cool thoroughly.

Follow either the Traditional Stuffing instructions _or_ the Bread Salad
instructions next.


**For the Traditional Stuffing:**

Clean the mushrooms, remove their stems, and roughly chop. In a frying pan 
over high heat, brown the mushrooms with some oil and a pinch of salt and 
pepper. Set aside.

Clean the frying pan, then put in the butter and melt over medium heat. Add
the leeks, sprig of thyme, and a pinch of salt, then cook over medium-low heat 
until leeks are soft. Add garlic and cook 1 minute or until fragrant. Add
3 cups of the reduced liquid and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat
to low. Taste liquid and adjust with salt and pepper as necessary. Make the 
mixture just a bit over salty. Remove sprigs of herbs.

In a very large bowl, put the dried bread and mushrooms. Pour the hot vegetables
and liquid over the bread and mushrooms. Fold carefully until all the bread
is thoroughly wet. If the bread is not completely wet, add more of the reduced
liquid or left over chicken stock if you run out. The bread mixture should be
totally soaked with just a bit of liquid that won't soak into the bread left in 
the bottom of the bowl. 

In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks and sugar until significantly lightened in 
color. Add 1/4 cup of reduced stock liquid (or plain chicken stock if you've run 
out) and whisk until combined. Pour egg mixture over wet bread mixture and 
immediately start folding to combine before it cooks on the hot bread mixture.


**For the Bread Salad:**

Put the butter, EVOO, shallots, and sprigs of herbs in a frying pan and cook 
over low heat until shallots are translucent. Add garlic and cook for a minute
or until fragrant. Add the wine and 3 cups of the reduced liquid and bring to
a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low. Taste liquid and adjust with salt
and pepper as necessary. Make the mixture just a bit over salty. Remove the
sprigs of herbs.

In a very large bowl, put the dried bread. Pour the hot vegetables and 
liquid over the bread. Fold carefully until all the bread is thoroughly wet. 
If the bread is not completely wet, add more of the reduced liquid or left 
over chicken stock if you run out. The bread mixture should be totally soaked 
with just a bit of liquid that won't soak into the bread left in the bottom of 
the bowl. 


## Roasting Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 375F.

Spray a large casserole dish (preferably glass or ceramic) with cooking oil.
Put the wet bread mixture into the casserole. Put the casserole dish on top of
a rimmed baking sheet. Put a metal drying rack on top of the casserole. Put
the salted and herbed chicken on the drying rack, taking care to make sure 
most of the chicken is above the bread. Roast the entire setup on a middle
rack of the oven. White meat pieces should be removed when they hit 160F
internally. Let dark meat go to 165F or even higher.

When chicken is done, remove the drying rack from the top of the bread mixture
and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Spray the bread mixture with cooking 
spray, and put it back in the oven. Raise oven temperature to 425F. Bake until 
bread mixture is golden brown and crispy on the edges. Remove from oven and 
let cool slightly.

Turn on your broiler and put the drying rack with the chicken over a rimmed 
baking sheet. Remove foil and broil the chicken until the skin is crispy and 
nicely browned. Be careful not to over broil!


**For Traditional Dressing**: Just serve!

**For Bread Salad:**

Put frisee in a very large bowl. Break up cooked bread mixture and spoon it 
over the frisee. Gently fold the mixture so that frisee slightly wilts. Add pine 
nuts, capers/pickles, and tarragon and mix. Drizzle mixture with EVOO and 
lemon juice as necessary to add brightness and properly dress the frisee.
