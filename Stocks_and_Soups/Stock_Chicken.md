## Better for your Bottom Line

## Ingredients

* 1 whole chicken carcass or equivalent, either roasted or raw
* 1 whole large onion, outermost layer and roots removed, quartered
* 2 carrots, broken in pieces
* 2 stalks celery, broken in pieces
* 2 clove garlic, smashed
* 3-5 stems of thyme, whole
* 5-10 peppercorns (optional)
* 1 bay leaf (optional)
* 5-10 whole corriander (optional)

Bones and pieces of chicken carcasses are fine, just make sure you have roughly the same
amount as a whole chicken carcass picked clean.  If you use the skin of the chicken,
make sure it isn’t too brown or burnt or covered in too much herbs or spices.  Discard
the skin if you are unsure.

Pieces of vegetables and herbs are also fine, but again make sure you have roughly the
same amount as 1 onion, 2 carrots, 2 stalks celery, 2 cloves garlic and a few whole stems
of thyme.  Spices can be omitted or changed up as you see fit.

## Get (Slowly) Simmering

Put the chicken carcass in the bottom of a 4 quart pot. A deep and tall pot is better
than a shallow and wide pot. Try to spread the carcass as evenly as possible on the bottom
of the pot. Put the veggies, herbs and spices on top of the chick.

Fill the pot nearly to the top with ice cold tap water.  Put over medium high heat,
uncovered, and bring to a gentle simmer.  Immediately reduce heat to low.  You are trying
to achieve a bare simmer where the top of the liquid is steaming and only a bubble or two
a second is breaking the surface of the water.

Continue to simmer for 6-8 hours.  During the coarse of simmering, you’ll need to
replenish the liquid occasionally.  Before replenishing the liquid, skim the surface of
fat or protein/foam.  Then add cold tap water to bring the water level back to where it
started and re-raise the temperature of the water over medium high heat before reducing
the heat back to low.

To be sure the stock is done, remove a bone from the liquid and see how brittle it is.
If it easily breaks, you know you’ve taken everything you can from the bones and the
stock is ready.

Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl. Then put the stock directly into
a tupperware container for freezing or refrigerating. Don’t wait for the stock to cool
before putting it into the refrigerator.  Stock will last a week in the fridge and
months in the freezer.

## Get Realistic

Not everyone has 6 hours to make this recipe.  I certainly don’t, at least not every
time I make it.  But even an hour or two of simmering will extract a terrific amount of
chicken and vegetable flavor.  You won’t get the amazing gelatin qualities of a true
stock with a short simmer, but it will still beat the pants off anything you could get
in the store.

I’ll often make stock right after an afternoon shopping trip or early evening family
meal.  That will leave me with roughly 3-5 hours to make this recipe.  In that case,
I’ll just let it simmer until I’m ready to go to bed, then strain it and pop it in
the fridge.

Is it perfect? No. But it is really tasty.
