## Cook Lobster

Fill a large, lidded pot with 1.5 inches of water. Add half a tablespoon of 
kosher salt and a bay leaf. Add a colandar, metal bowl or steamer basket to 
keep the lobster out of the water (optional). Cover pot and bring water to 
boil over high heat.

When water is boiling, remove lid and add 2 lobsters, shell side down 
(claws and tail pointed up and out of the water) to the pot. Immediately 
cover the pot and reduce heat to medium.

Steam lobsters according to the following timetable:
 - 3/4 Lb Lobster, 10 minutes
 - 1 Lb Lobster, 11 minutes
 - 1 1/4 Lb Lobster, 12 minutes
 - 1 1/2 Lb Lobster, 13 minutes
 - 1 3/4 - 2 Lb Lobster, 14 minutes
 - More than 2 Lb Lobster, 15-17 minutes

When done, remove lobsters from the pot immediately and put into a bowl to cool.
Remove steaming basket from the pot. Save the water from the pot in a separate
bowl. Remove the bay leaf and add back to the pot.

To remove meat, first pull all the legs, claws and tail off of the lobster body. 
Break up the body shell a bit using a large knife before adding back to the pot,
guts and all. Using a knife or a seafood cracker, crack the shells of the claws
and tail. Pull claw and tail meat using a small fork. For the legs, use a 
rolling pin to roll the meat out of the shell. Start at the foot end and roll
toward the end that was attached to the body.

Put meat into an air tight container in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Any remaining shells, guts, water, and pieces should go back into the pot.



## Lobster Stock

Cut 1 large onion, 2 large carrots and 2 large celery sticks into large pieces 
and add to the pot. Add 3 cloves of garlic, crushed. Add 5 black peppercorns.

Fill the pot with water until the water covers the lobsters and vegetables by 
1.5 to 2 inches. Put on medium high heat until the water barely simmers. Reduce 
heat to medium low and continue a bare simmer for 3 hours, until the liquid 
has significantly reduced and is a medium shade of brown. If the water isn not
reducing fast enough, turn up heat.

Once reduced, strain lobster stock through a metal seive or cheese cloth into
a large bowl. Set aside.


 
## Bisque

In a large pot over low-medium heat, melt butter and add shallots and carrot.
Sautee very slowly, without much sizzling, until the shallots are translucent.
Add paprika, bay leaf, and thyme and continue to sautee until fragrant, 1-2
minutes. Add tomato paste and stir until completely incorporated. Sautee for
another 1-2 minutes, until tomato scent has deepened. Add tomatoes and increase
heat to medium. Continue to sautee until all liquid has evaporated and mixture 
begins to sizzle. 

Add wine, lobster stock, reserved lobster water, rice, and saffron. Bring 
mixture to a light simmer and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove bay leaf and thyme,
add brandy and simmer for another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.

Using either an immersion blender or a regular blender, blend bisque in small
batches until completley smooth. For additional smoothness, push soup through
a metal seive after blending. Finish with whipping cream, salt, pepper and 
lemon juice, to taste. Bisque may be held for up to 2 days in the fridge 
before serving.

To serve, warm bisque in a large pot over low heat. Melt 2 Tbsp butter in a 
frying pan over low heat. Add chopped lobster meat and heat until just warm.
Add small mounds of meat to the serving bowl and pour the bisque around the 
meat. Garnish with chives.
