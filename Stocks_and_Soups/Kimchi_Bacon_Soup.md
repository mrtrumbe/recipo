## Sourcing Ingredients

Given that this recipe is basically three ingredients (kimchi, bacon and dashi) with a
minimal amount of cooking and prep, the dish stands and falls on the quality of those
ingredients. Pay attention to what you are putting into this dish.

Visit an asian grocery to find quality kimchi. Kimchi, with it’s tanginess, ginger, garlic,
spice and funky fish products, is the primary flavor driver for the soup. I like a little
radish in my kimchi for this recipe to add a bit of extra crunch and punch.

For the bacon, use something smokey and thick. We’ll be rendering the fat and adding it
back into the soup and your typical Oscar Meyer slice, besides being far less tasty than
a better slice, would just fall apart.

For the dashi, [make your own](http://matthewtrumbell.tumblr.com/post/45083258510/dashi).
Seriously. Just do it. A batch of dashi takes about 30 minutes to put together, refrigerates
and freezes well, and tastes so, so good. For this recipe, it is somewhat important not
to use instant dashi as it is loaded with salt and the bacon and kimchi already add plenty
of salt to the dish.


## Ingredients

Serves 4 as a starter.

* 5 slices of thick-cut bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces, warmed to room temperature
* 1 cup kimchi, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 4 cups dashi
* 2 tbsp mirin
* 4 scallions, white parts removed, sliced very thin


## Putting it Together

Put the bacon in a large pot and place over medium-low heat. Very slowly, render the fat
from the bacon. A little browning is OK, but take it slow in an attempt to get the majority
of the fat out of the bacon without crisping it. This should take about 10-15 minutes.

When the bacon has been rendered, remove it from the pan and place on a piece of paper
towel. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat from the pot.

Turn the heat up to medium-high and get the pot hot. Add the kimchi and stir-fry it for
2-3 minutes, until it has cooked slightly and releases and pungent odor. Immediately pour
in 1 cup of the dashi, using it to loosen any bits of bacon or kimchi stuck to the bottom
of the pot. Add the rest of the dashi, the bacon and the mirin and bring to a low simmer
before reducing the heat to medium-low. Simmer for 5 minutes.

## Serve

Taste the soup and add mirin (for sweetness) and salt as necessary. Serve immediately,
with a nice heap of scallions on top.
