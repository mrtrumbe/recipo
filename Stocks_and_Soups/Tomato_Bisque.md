# Tomato Bisque

## Ingredients

* 1 whole head of garlic
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 large onions, chopped
* 1 carrot, chopped
* 1 celery stalk, chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 x 28oz cans of peeled whole tomatoes
* 1 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 cup white wine, bright and not overly sweet is best
* 2 cups chicken stock (veg stock can be substituted)
* 2 tbsp brown sugar, packed
* 2 bay leaves
* 5 whole black peppercorns
* 5 whole white peppercorns
* 1 whole clove
* 1 tbsp Kosher salt
* 3 slices of quality white sandwich bread, crusts removed and ripped into chunks
* 4-8 tbsp quality extra-virgin olive oil


## Ingredient Prep

Lightly oil the head of garlic and roast in a 400F oven for about 20-30 minutes or until
very soft. You can roast right on the rack of your oven. Let cool until you can easily handle
it, then squeeze out the garlic and set aside.

Put the bay leaves, the peppercorns and the cloves in a small piece of cheese cloth or a tea
infuser. This makes fishing them out later much easier.

Optionally, seed the tomatoes, removing the tomato solids and straining the liquid of the
tomatoes. Some people find the seeds bitter, but you probably wonâ€™t notice the difference.


## Get Cooking

Heat a dutch oven or large pot over medium-low heat. Add the 2 tbsp of oil, onion, carrot,
celery and a pinch of salt. Cook the vegetables slowly, sweating them, until they are translucent.
You should only hear a faint sizzle from the pan and should avoid browning.

Increase heat to medium and add minced garlic and tomato paste. Cook for 1-2 minutes. Add tomatoes,
wine, chicken stock, brown sugar, roasted garlic, salt and spices. Increase heat to high and
bring to a good simmer.  Reduce heat to a bare simmer.

Gently simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.


## Get Blending

Remove the spices from the soup. Add bread chunks to the soup and simmer and stir until they are
completely soaked and start falling apart, 1-2 minutes.

If using an immersion blender, put it into the soup and (carefully!) blend away. If using a
traditional blender, work in batches and be sure not to overload the blender. Either way, blend
until the soup is a consistent, smooth texture.

Remove 3-4 cups of the soup.  If using a traditional blender, put the removed soup into the
blender.  If using an immersion blender, put the removed soup into a separate container suitable
for blending.  With the blender running on a medium speed, drizzle the extra virgin olive oil
into the removed soup.  The mixture will thicken substantially during this process and lighten in
color.  You can choose how creamy the soup will be by adding more or less oil during this step.

Add the soup and oil mixture to the original pot and mix thoroughly.  Taste and adjust seasoning
with salt, pepper (either black or white will do) and a nice vinegar.


## Get Hardcore

The soup will be ready at this point, delicious and smooth.  But if you want a truly luxurious
texture, push it through a fine metal sieve or strainer.  With the bread in the mixture, this
proves to be quite a bit of work, but the end results are unmatched.


## Serve

A dollop of cream, creme friache or sour creme is a nice addition when serving.  Chives or
chervil, finely chopped, are also nice accompaniments.
