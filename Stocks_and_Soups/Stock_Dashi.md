## Find the Ingredients

While you can find the core elements at some supermarkets and upscale markets
(Whole Foods, for instance), you are probably best served finding an asian
grocery or ordering them online.  You’ll pay less and, depending on what your
local grocery carries, get better quality ingredients.

While there are many types of dashi, this recipe focuses on the most popular
form: kombu and katsuobushi dashi. Here’s what you are looking for…

* Kombu - A seaweed, this is sold in a dried form that looks like broad, dark
    green sticks. You might see white dust or spots on the kombu, but this is
    OK.  That white stuff has flavor!
* Katsuobushi (aka: bonito flakes) - This is the flesh of a small tuna that
    has been smoked and dried. In some places you can find it in whole form
    which you then need to flake yourself. In the US, it is pretty much only
    available in pre-flaked form sold in air-tight bags.

And that’s the hard part. Once you have the ingredients, this is as simple
as recipes get.

## Ingredients

* 10 cups of cold water
* 0.6-0.7 ounces dried kombu (about 3-4 sticks)
* 0.5 ounces dried bonito flakes (about a cup)
* Get Steeping

Put the kombu into a large pot and pour the water over it. Let soak for 15
minutes. The kombu will expand into sheets during this soak.

Put the pot over medium-high heat. The goal is to remove the kombu from the
water when it gets to about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. If you aren’t using a
thermometer, look for small bubbles to form on the bottom and sides of the
pot and you’ll know you are in the ballpark.  There’s some wiggle room here,
but you don’t want to boil the kombu as the dashi will end up bitter.

After removing the kombu, bring the water just to a boil over medium-high
heat. Turn the heat to the very lowest setting and add the bonito flakes.
Steep the bonito flakes for about 5 minutes. The flakes should sink to the
bottom. If not, use a spoon to stir the mixture up and steep for another
minute.

Strain the dashi using a fine metal strainer (or, to remove more small
particles, through cheese cloth). If you aren’t going to use the dashi
immediately, put it into an air tight container and put immediately into
the refrigerator to cool.  The dashi should be used or frozen within a week.

## Second Dashi

If you reserve the bonito flakes and kombu you used in making the dashi,
you can make whats known as second dashi. Second dashi is a slightly less
flavorful and complex dashi made from the leftovers of first dashi. It is
still excellent dashi, just not as good as the first go around.

The procedure is identical, just re-use the ingredients.
