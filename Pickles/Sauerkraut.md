# Sauerkraut

## Ingredients

* 1 large head of white cabbage
* Kosher salt
* Caraway seeds (optional)

Special equipment:

* An accurate scale
* Two 32oz mason jars or equivalent volume air-tight containers, cleaned thoroughly
* Pickling weights. Plastic baggies full of salt water work in a pinch.
* A large stick-like utensil to pack the cabbage. A muddler works well. The end of a spatula works in a pinch.


## Make the Sauerkraut

Pull off any limp or dirty leaves from the outside of the cabbage. Give the head
a quick rinse. Cut the head into quarters, then cut out the core of the cabbage
from each quarter.

Cut the cabbage into thin strips. Ideally the strips are 1/8" to 1/4" wide. Once
all of the cabbage has been cut, weigh the cabbage with your scale.

To calculate how much salt you need, take 2% of the weight of your cabbage. For
example if you have 1000g of cabbage, you would calculate how much salt you need
with:

  1000g * 0.02 = 10g

Once you've calculated how much you need, weigh out the proper amount of salt
using your scale. Put the cabbage into a large bowl and sprinkle the salt over the
top. Mix thoroughly to combine.

If you are using caraway seeds, toast them in a pan over medium heat until fragrant.
Then sprinkle the seeds over the top of the cabbage mixture and stir to combine.

Let the cabbage mixture sit for 30 minutes.


## Fermentation

After 30 minutes, give the mixture another stir to distribute the water that will
have leaked from the cabbage and pack into the containers. 

The mixture will not fit into the jars without packing. Packing not only allows us
to get all of the mixture into our jars, but it also ensures our cabbage stays
below the surface of the liquid, which will prevent spoilage. To pack the sauerkraut, 
add cabbage mixture to the jar until full, then pack it down with your stick. You'll
have to push relatively hard. Ensure that each time you do it, the cabbage is below
the liquid level. Repeat until all the cabbage mixture is in the jars.

Leave 2" of room between the top of the liquid and the lid of the jar, leaving out
some of the mixture if necessary. As fermentation occurs, the mixture will expand
and you need room at the top of the jar to avoid spillage when you open them. Put 
a pickling weight in each jar to hold the cabbage below the surface of the liquid.
Wipe down the outside of the jars to keep things clean and allow a good seal. Put
the top on each jar, but do not over-tigheten.

Place the jars at room temperature outside of direct sunlight. Check on the jars
daily and "burp" them at least once a day by quickly opening the jar, letting some
gas out, then closing the jar back up. Burping is VERY important as the gas will
build up and could burst your container. 

Allow your sauerkraut to ferment at room temperature for 2-4 weeks depending on
the temperature. The longer you let the ferment go, the tangier the sauerkraut
will be. After two weeks, taste the sauerkraut and then taste every few days
until it reaches the desired flavor. Then put the sauerkraut in the fridge. It
can be eaten immediately, but the flavor will improve over the next couple of 
weeks.
