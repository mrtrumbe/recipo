# Fermented Pickles

Wash and cut your vegetables, cover in salt water, and wait and you'll get fermented pickles. It's that easy! The lactic bacteria will eat 
the vegetables, producing acid and flavors, and the salt and resulting acid will protect the whole thing from spoiling. 

But there are a few things you can do to make them great pickles and ensure you don't get a bad batch.


## Getting the brine right.

Salt type is **important**. Do not use iodized table salt as it'll kill off the good bacteria and ruin a batch. Use kosher, pickling, or sea salt.
The water matters, too, and the chlorine in tap water kills good bacteria. Use filtered or bottled water.

You also want your brine at room temperature when you add it to the vegetables. To dissolve the salt quickly, I put 1 cup of water in a sauce pan on
the stove, add the salt, then heat and stir until the salt is dissolved. Then measure the rest of your water, including a few ice cubes, then add in your
hot salt water. This usually results in room temp-ish brine.

Depending on the type of vegetable, you should use a different level of salt in your brine. Here is a table of vegetables and the salt 
brine percentage you should use.

| **Vegetable** | **Salt %** |
| :--------     | -------:   |
| Cucumbers | 4.5 |
| Green Beans | 2.5 |
| Cauliflower | 2.0 |
| Tomatoes | 2.0 |
| Radishes | 5.0 |
| Peppers | 5.0 |
| Carrots | 2.5 |

The easiest way to get the right percentage is to use a [brine calculator](https://myfermentedfoods.com/tools/brine-calculator/) and weight your salt. 
But I've also found that you don't need to have the percentage *perfect* to get good results, either. A rule of thumb is that every 1 Tbsp of kosher salt
added to 4 cups of water adds 1.5% to the salt percentage. Want 4% salt brine? Add 2 and 2/3rds Tbsp kosher salt to 4 cups of water.


## Weigh down your vegetables.

You need to make sure your vegetables are submerged while they ferment. Vegetables that peek above the surface can cause mold to form and potentially ruin a batch.

You can buy glass pickling weights online that perfectly fit mason jars. The combo makes for a perfect pickling vessle. If you don't have glass weights, 
you can use plastic baggies partially filled with brine and they work just as well.


## Add some flavor.

You want some additions to your brine, so add aromatics, herbs, and spices to liven up your pickles. You can do pretty much anything but here are some ideas.

Aromatics:
- Garlic, smashed (this also adds a bit of spice to your pickle)
- Shallots, roughly sliced
- Onions, roughly sliced
- Ginger, sliced
- Celery, sliced

Herbs (always use fresh):
- Dill
- Parsley
- Tarragon
- Basil

Spices (always use whole spices):
- Back Peppercorn
- Mustard seed
- Fennel seed
- Cloves
- Cinnamon stick
- Cumin
- Corriander
- Fenugreek
- Carroway
- Red pepper flake (for spice and flavor)


## Add some leaves.

To keep your pickles crispy, add some leaves! Leaves have tannins in them that help give your pickle a crunch. You can use a wide variety of leaves here:

- Bay leaves, which are readily available and add a nice aromatic punch
- Green tea leaves (whole, not the ground stuff in a tea bag)
- Oak leaves
- Maple leaves

If you are making a sauce with your pickled veg (like a hot sauce from pickled peppers), leave out the leaves for a smoother sauce.


## Time to pickle!

Thoroughly rinse and scrub your vegetables and trim any leaves, roots, or bad spots from them. Cut them into bit sized chunks. Thoroughly rinse any 
herbs and leaves. Prepare your aromatics and spices. Clean two large mason jars with screw on lids.

Add your vegetable chunks a layer at a time, then add some of the herbs, leaves, aromatics, and spices. Repeat until your jar is 3/4 full.

Add a weight to the top, then pour your brine over until the vegetable mixture is completely submerged. Screw on the top.

Put the jar in a place that doesn't get too hot or cold and out of direct sunlight. Pickle for 1 to 2 weeks (or even more) to the desired level of acidity. 
The longer you go, the more tart they will get. Be sure to "burp" the jar every day to ensure it doesn't blow up. The fermentation process produces gas
and it will build up over time. Just open the lid a little bit to let some of the gas out every day.


## How do I know if they are good to eat?

Use your nose and taste. If it smells bad or if it tastes bad, toss it. There is a little natural "funkiness" to fermented pickles, but you can easily
tell when a batch is bad because it won't smell or taste like a pickle.

Mold or a white yeast film will occasionally grow on the top of the brine as you pickle. Scrape it off and let the jar sit another day, then come back and smell 
it. If it is smelly when you check again, the batch is bad and you should toss it.
