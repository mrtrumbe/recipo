## Bacteria, Salt and Cucumbers

Fermented pickles rely on lactic bacteria (no relation to lactose in milk products)
to create acidity and preserve the vegetables. We want to encourage these "good"
bacteria and limit "bad" bacteria. There are three keys to doing this: cleaning
ingredients and utensils, using the right amount of salt and using proper cucumbers.

First make sure everything you are using is sanitary. If your pickling vessel or utensils
are contaminated, you'll increase the chance bad bacteria will grow. Give everything a
good wash before you start and thoroughly rinse the garlic and herbs and leave out to dry.
We'll talk more about cleaning and prepping cucumbers later.

For the salt, you want exactly 5.5 ounces of salt per gallon of water. This amount
allows lactic bacteria to thrive while limiting the growth of other bad bacteria.
Preferably, you'd have pure salt (pickling salt, kosher salt or sea salt without
additives), but even plain table salt works, iodized, anti-caking agents and all. Your
best bet is to weigh the salt, but if you don't have a&nbsp;scale, here is how you get
5.5 ounces of salt using measuring cups (courtesy of
[Morton Salt](http://www.mortonsalt.com/for-your-home/culinary-salts/salt-conversion-chart)).
You'll have to use a different measure depending on the salt type:

* 1/2 cup plus 1/2 tbsp for table salt, fine sea salt or pickling salt
* 1/2 cup plus 2 1/2 tbsp for kosher salt or coarse sea salt

For cucumbers, it is quite important you only use cucumbers suitable for pickling
(AKA, kirbys). Garden, english and those mini pre-packaged cucumbers not only have wax
on the outside of them, but they make lousy, soggy pickles. Most supermarkets have pickling
cucumbers these days, so if you don't see them, ask. I've heard lemon cucumbers work well,
too, but haven't tried them.

When picking pickling cucumbers, you are looking for the freshest product available. Don't
even bother with old or very mature cucumbers. In the best case scenario, you'll get mushy
or hollow pickles. Worst case, they'll be harboring bad bacteria and will contaminate the
batch. Accordingly, smaller, firmer and greener is better. Be picky and give the cucumbers
a good feel before buying.

## Hardware

Ideally, you would have a pickling crock and weight for fermentation. &nbsp;But really,
any large container will work, so long as you can find a way to keep the pickles submerged
in the brine during fermentation. &nbsp;A large pot that is taller than it is wide will
usually suffice if you can find the right weight.

A nice trick I learned from [Alton Brown](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/dill-pickles-recipe/index.html)
is to use a gallon plastic bag full of brine (sealed, of course) to weigh the pickles down.
If you go that route, be sure that the plastic bag is bigger that the opening in the pot,
so that pickles can't squeeze around the sides of the bag.


## Pickling Spice

Don't buy pickling spice. &nbsp;You probably have everything you need to make a good mix
in your kitchen already and your spice will taste better than store bought. For 2 Tbsp of
pickling spice, here's the mixture I like to use:

* 2 tsp Black Peppercorns
* 2 tsp Red Pepper flakes
* 1 tsp whole corriander
* 1 tsp whole yellow mustard
* 2 cloves, broken into pieces

Most whole spices work very well for pickling, so experiment until you find a mix you like.


## Ingredients

* 1 gallon of cold water
* 5.5 ounces of salt
* 3 pounds pickling cucumbers
* 2 tbsp pickling spice
* 3-6 cloves of garlic, crushed
* 1 bunch of fresh dill

More garlic makes the pickles more garlicky (obviously), but it will also contribute to the
spice level, so tailor the amount according to your tastes.


## Put it Together

Lightly toast the pickling spices in a small saucepan over medium heat. When toasted, add
3 cups of the cold water to the saucepan and then add all of the salt. Heat and stir the water
until all of the salt has dissolved. Add the hot water back to the cold water and thoroughly
mix together. Set the brine aside.

Prep the cucumbers one at a time. First, rinse and thoroughly clean a cucumber under cold
running water. Then, cut off a little bit of the cucumber off of each end and rinse again.
This cutting is optional, but I've found my pickles are more consistently crunchy when I do
it (the blossom end, in particular, has enzymes that will make pickles mushy). For me, it's
a small aesthetic sacrifice for consistently crunchy pickles.

Put the prepped pickles into a very cold water bath (throw in some ice) until you are ready
to use them.

Drain the cucumbers, then layer the cucumbers, garlic and dill in your pickling vessel, trying
to spread things around as evenly as possible. Then, pour the brine over the top of the
cucumbers until there's enough liquid to easily submerge them completely. Try to get as much
of the spice into the vessel as possible and use a spoon to put the rest of the spices in if
you have left over brine.

Put your weight on top of the cucumbers taking care to ensure that all the pickles are fully
submerged and there are no pockets of air under the weight or cucumbers. It is important that
the vessel NOT be air tight to allow gases to escape, but keeping the top loosely covered
(with a plate, for instance) will help limit exposure to oxygen, which discourages bad
bacterial growth.

## Ferment!

Stash your pickling vessel in a relatively cool corner of your house where it won't be
disrupted. The pickles will be ready in as little as five days and can be fermented for as
many as 3 weeks. The longer you let the pickles ferment, the more sour and "funky" they'll get.
I'd say the sweet spot for most people is about 7-12 days. The temperature during fermentation
will also play a role and the higher the temperature, the faster the fermentation. Try to
make sure the temperature during fermentation remains below 75F to make sure the lactic
bacteria can thrive.

Once the pickles are done to your liking, place the vessel in the refrigerator to stop the
fermentation. After 1-3 days in the fridge, your pickles are done.

You should check on your pickles every day or two during fermentation. Here is a checklist
to run through when you tend to them:

* Look for signs of fermentation that will start after 2-3 days: bubbles, the brine turning
    cloudy, the cucumbers turning a muddy green.
* Check for a skin or foam on the top of the brine. This is caused by yeast growth and needs
    to be removed lest it ruin the batch. Just skim it off the top using a spoon. If the skin
    gets on your weight, remove as much of the skin as possible, remove the weight, rinse it
    thoroughly and replace.
* Check for off odors. Your pickles should smell like...well, pickles. If you notice any
    strange odors, you might have a bad batch. Let them ferment another day or two and if
    the odor persists, you'll need to throw everything out and start over.

Bad batches do happen, but they are rare, if you are careful.

## Trub

One interesting by-product of fermented pickles is trub, a term I'm borrowing from beer
brewing. When brewing, during the fermentation phase, yeast will eat all of the sugar it can,
then fall out of the wort and settle on the bottom of the fermentation vessel. That yeast
forms a white powdery substance. If you let your fermentation go long enough, you'll
see a similar substance at the bottom of your pickling vessel.

[![Trub](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/8913670844_9f544a67ee_b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/97407207@N00/8913670844/)

The process of fermentation in brewing and in pickling are quite similar: both rely on tiny
organisms to eat the sugar in a solution to covert the solution. When brewing, we use yeast
to eat sugar and produce alcohol. When pickling, we use naturally occurring lactic bacteria
to eat sugar and produce acid (which pickles our vegetables).

One common practice in brewing is to collect the trub to use as a yeast starter for subsequent
batches of beer. I'll be experimenting with bacterial starters for pickling and will report
back on the results.
