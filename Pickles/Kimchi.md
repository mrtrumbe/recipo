# Kimchi

## Ingredients

For cabbage:

* 2 large heads napa cabbage
* 1.5 cups kosher salt
* water


For paste:

* 1/2 cup cooked rice (leftovers are fine)
* 1/4 of an asian pear, peeled and cored
* 3/4 cup of water
* 2 tsp honey
* 2" chunk of ginger
* 1/3 cup korean fish sauce (preferably made from anchovies)
* 1/4 cup korean-style salted shrimp
* 1 head of garlic, peeled and trimmed
* 1 bunch scallions, rinsed, light green portions sliced thin
* 1 cup gochugaru


Additions:

* 1 medium daikon
* leftover scallion parts


Special Equipment:

* 4 x 32 ounce mason jars or an equivalent volume air-tight container, cleaned thoroughly


## Substitutions

If you have trouble finding salted shrimp, omit it and increase the amount of 
fish sauce to 1/2 cup.

If you can't find korean fish sauce, thai fish sauce can be used, but it will alter
the taste of the kimchi.

Sweet apples can be substituted for the asian pear. Fuji, gala, and honey crisp
are all good substitutes.

There's really no substitute for gochugaru. Get it at a Korean grocery or order
online. The really good stuff is a bright vibrant red. Gochugaru varies in heat
level, so read the label carefully.


## Cabbage Prep

Pull any limp or dirty leaves from the outside of the cabbages and give the heads
a quick rinse. Cut a 2" deep cross in the core end of each cabbage and then tear the
cabbage into 4 pieces. Working with one piece of cabbage at a time, put it in a 
large bowl, then sprinkle liberally with salt, pulling back individual leaves
to make sure salt gets between all the leaves. When all pieces have been salted, 
pour any remaining salt over the top of the cabbage in the bowl. Let sit for 30
minutes.

After 30 minutes, cover the cabbage with cold water and let it soak for an additional
2 hours. You can make the paste and prep additional ingredients while you wait.

After 2 hours, pour out all of the water and individually rinse each piece of
cabbage, taking care to rinse between the leaves. Put the cabbage pieces into a
collander or on towels to drain thoroughly.

Cut off the core of each cabbange piece then, cutting in the same direction as
the cut off the core, slice the cabbage into 1" strips. Put the cabbage into a large
bowl.


## Prepare the Paste 

In a blender or food processor, add the cooked rice, asian pear, water, honey, 
and ginger. If you like a smooth paste, add in the garlic, salted shrimp and sliced 
scallions. Blend until smooth.

Put liquid into a medium bowl. Add the gochugaru and stir thoroughly to combine.
If you haven't yet added garlic, salted shrimp, and scallions, cut those 
ingredients to the size you like and add to the mixture. Stir to combine.

Taste the mixture and add more gochugaru if you want it spicier. You can also adjust
the salt and sweet levels by adding kosher salt and honey at this point.


## Prepare the Additions

Peel the daikon and slice however you like. Matchsticks are a popular form.

Cut the leftover scallion pieces into whatever size you like.


## Prepare the Kimchi

Add the additions to the cabbage and mix. This is your opportunity to get the right
balance of cabbage to radish to scallion, so only add how much you want. Add the
paste to the mixture and mix until every piece of vegetable is thoroughly covered.
Hands are the best tool for this, but you might want to wear gloves.

Put the mixed kimchi into your mason jars or airtight containers and press down to 
remove air from the mixture. Be sure to leave roughly 2" of space between the kimchi 
mixture and the top of the container to avoid overflow as it ferments. Wipe down the
outside of the container to keep everything clean and ensure a good seal on the 
container. then put the tops on. Do not over-tighten the top! Put the container in 
a 70-ish degree farenheit location away from direct sunlight.


## Ferment the Kimchi

Leave the kimchi at room temperature for 1 to 4 days, "burping" the container by
opening it slightly then closing it back up 1-2 times a day. Burping is VERY
important because the container could burst due to the pressure buildup as the 
mixture ferments and releases CO2. 

The longer you leave the kimchi at room temperature, the more tangy and fizzy 
it will get. Taste it daily until it's to your liking. Once you get it where you
want, move the container to the fridge. Continue to check the containers in 
the fridge for few days to ensure pressure isn't building up. You can eat it 
once it's cold, but it tastes even better if you wait a week or two.
