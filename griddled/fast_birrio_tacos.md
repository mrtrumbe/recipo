Fast Birrio Tacos
-----------------

Not authentic, but quick and tasty. Makes about 4 tacos.

**For the "stew":**
- 1/3-1/2 pound of leftover shredded meat (pork, chicken, goat if you've got it)
- 2 tbsp hot sauces (sriracha, habenero, chipotle, etc.)
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 tsp lime/lemon juice
- 1 bouillon cube, crushed
- 2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp oregano

**For the tacos:**
- corn tortillas
- melting cheese
- diced onion
- cilantro, leaves picked and torn

For the stew, mix everything but the meat in a microwave safe bowl. Cook in the microwave on high for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally until it is bubbly and the bouillon is dissolved. Add meat to and cook for an additional 30 sec to a minute until everything is warm. Remove and strain meat onto a plate, leaving liquid in the bowl. Salt and pepper the liquid to taste.

Heat a griddle or cast iron pan over medium high heat. Make the tacos in batches of 2-3:
- Dip a corn tortilla in the liquid, using a spoon to ensure itâ€™s completely covered in liquid on both sides. Place on the griddle and repeat with additional tortillas.
- Fill one half of the tortilla with melting cheese, meat, diced onion, cilantro, and a drizzle of additional liquid.
- Fold the tortilla over and drizzle a little more liquid on top of the tortilla.
- Continue to cook until bottom is nicely charred.
- Flip and cook the other side until charred.
- Eat immediately.
