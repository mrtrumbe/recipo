## Instructions

Rinse lentils thoroughly and drain.

Dice the onion and tomatoes. Heat dutch oven or large sauce pot over medium heat. Add oil, onions, baking soda, 
and a pinch of salt to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are brown, adding a little water periodically 
as they darken to incorporate the caramelization from the bottom of the pan into the onions.

While onions cook, prepare the Whole, Tempered, and Last Minutes Spices and put them in 3 separate bowls.

Once onions are brown, add tomatoes and cook until broken down. Add lentils and water, turn heat to high, and heat 
until boiling. Put lid on pot, bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and cook lentils for 30-40 minutes, 
stirring periodically. When lentils are tender, use potato masher mash to desired consistency with potato masher, then cover 
and turn heat to low to keep warm.

Heat a small pan on medium-low. This next part goes quickly and make sure the pan doesnâ€™t get too hot or the spices will burn.
Add Whole Spice ingredients and cook for 30 seconds. Add Tempered Spices and cook for 30 seconds. Turn off heat on spices and 
wait a few seconds. Add spices and oil to lentils along with last minute spices. Add Serving Ingredients to lentils, and stir 
thoroughly.

Taste, then season with salt, sugar, and acid (lemon juice) as needed.
