# Cast Iron Cornbread

This is somewhere in between sweet northern-style cornbread and traditional
southern-style cornbread. Not too sweet, moist and flavorful. Get good
quality, freshly milled corn meal for best results.

You'll need a standard, 9-inch cast iron skillet for this recipe.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 cups cornmeal
* 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1/3 cup milk (whole preferred, skim or 2% works too)
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 8 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
* 1 tbsp butter

## Instructions

_The dry and wet ingredients can be prepped up to a couple of hours ahead of 
time. Just leave the separate bowls on the counter and follow the 
instructions on the cast iron before continuing._

Mix together all the dry ingredients except the sugar in a large bowl 
(cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda). In a second bowl, whisk
the eggs until loose, then add the sugar and whisk until mixture lightens in
color. While still whisking, slowly drizzle the melted butter into the egg
and sugar mixture, then continue whisking until fully incorporated. While
continuing to whisk, slowly pour milk and buttermilk into the mixture
until everything is combined.

When ready to bake, preheat oven to 400F and place empty cast iron skillet
into the oven to preheat with the oven. When oven and cast iron are hot
(give it some extra time to make sure), slowly whisk the wet ingredients
into the dry ingredients just until combined.

Remove the cast iron skillet from the oven and put the tbsp of butter in it
until melted. Distribute the butter in the skillet. Add the batter to the
skillet, evening the top, then place directly into the oven. Cook
18-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out
cleanly. Remove from the oven, allow to cool a bit in the skillet, then
cut and serve directly from the skillet.
