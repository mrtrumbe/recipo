# Souffle


## The Souffle Framework

No matter what kind of souffle you are making, the procedure is exactly the same:

* Separate the egg whites from the yolks.
* Create about 1 1/3 cups of a viscous, flavorful liquid.
* Incorporate half of the egg yolks into the liquid.
* Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks and incorporate into the liquid.
* Bake.

That's it. Souffles have a reputation for being fickle and fragile. While things can go wrong, the
techniques you use are common and, if you are careful, you won't face any problems.

Below, you'll find a recipe for a somewhat unique chicken souffle. In that recipe, we start with some
shallots and butter, then make a roux and add reduced chicken stock to create a flavorful chicken
gravy. But transforming this recipe into a sweet chocolate souffle is trivial: simply melt semi-
sweet chocolate and a pad of butter and add a bit of vanilla or other flavoring and use that as
your base liquid instead.

Below the main recipe, you'll find variations for how to build your flavor bases. Switching up your
souffle is as simple as swapping out the base.



## Treating Eggs Right

The most common problem with a souffle is a lack of rise during cooking. This is easily prevented
by working carefully with your eggs, especially your egg whites. Here's how you avoid problems:

* Make sure the bowls you are using for egg whites are very clean and have no oil or fat on them
at all. Metal bowls are preferable to glass bowls to help prevent oil from hanging around.

* Separate the egg white of each egg into a small bowl. Check the white carefully for traces of
egg yolk before putting the egg white into the main mixing bowl. If there is any trace of yolk
in the white, discard the white.

* Use a couple pinches of cream of tartar when whipping the egg whites. This helps ensure stability.

* Don't over-whip your egg whites. You are looking to just get to stiff peaks (meaning that when
you pull the whisk from the egg white mixture and turn it over, the peak stays firmly up). As you
get close to the right point, check the mixture for doneness often and stop as soon as you reach
the stiff peak phase. Over-whipped whites will start to leak moisture and aren't as stable as
properly whipped whites.



## Ingredients

Base:

* 6 eggs, separated into 6 whites and 3 yolks (save or discard the remaining yolks)
* 1/8 tsp cream of tartar
* 1-2 tbsp softened butter

Flavoring liquid:

* 3 cups chicken stock (preferably home made)
* 1/4 tsp finely diced fresh thyme
* 1/4 tsp finely diced fresh sage
* 1/2 tsp finely diced fresh parsely
* 1/8 tsp fresh ground black pepper
* 3 tbsp unsalted butter
* 1 tbsp finely diced shallots
* 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 3 tbsp all purpose flour
* 1 tbsp finely grated parmesan cheese
* squeeze of fresh lemon juice


## Prep

Preheat oven to 350F.

Prepare two 24oz. souffle dishes by lightly buttering the sides and bottom of the dishes,
then coating with a thin layer of grated parmesan cheese. Knock on the souffles over a sink
to remove excess cheese.


## Flavor

In a small sauce pan, bring the stock to a strong simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat
to medium-low and slowly simmer the stock for 20-30 minutes, until it has reduced by half.
When reduced, remove from heat and measure out 1 and 1/3 cups. Discard the extra stock or
add a little water if you don't have enough liquid.

Mix the herbs and black pepper together in a small dish.

In a medium sauce pan, melt the butter over medium low heat. When melted, add the shallot
and the salt and sautee for 1-2 minutes, until the shallots are translucent. Add the flour
to make a roux and whisk thoroughly into the butter and shallots. Cook over medium low heat
for 2-3 minutes, whisking frequently, until the roux loses its raw flour smell.

Slowly whisk in the chicken stock into the roux in the saucepan over medium heat, 1/4 of the
liquid at a time. After each addition, whisk the mixture thoroughly until it thickens and
becomes smooth. The first addition will clump up significantly, but subsequent additions
should result in a smooth liquid. Add 1/2 of the herb mixture, stir in well, then bring
the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low and slowly simmer for 5 minutes. Remove
from heat and let cool for 5-10 minute.


## Adding Structure

In a large mixing bowl (or the bowl of an electric mixer) combine the egg whites and
cream of tartar and whip until foamy.

In a large mixing bowl, whip the egg yolks for 2-3 minutes, until they lighten in color
and get slightly frothy.

Add a few tablespoons of the liquid to the egg yolk mixture and whisk thoroughly until
combined. Add 1/2 of the remaining liquid and mix thoroughly. Add and mix remaining liquid.
Add the rest of the herb mixture, the cheese and the squeeze of lemon juice to the liquid
and mix thoroughly.

Whisk the egg whites (or mix on high with your mixer's whisk attachment) until they
reach stiff peaks. Add 1/3 of the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture and mix thoroughly
to combine. Don't worry about being careful with the first addition. Add 1/2 of the remaining
egg whites and carefully fold the whites in the yolk mixture until almost completely
integrated. There will still be small white lumps in the mixture. Add the remaining
egg whites and fold in.

Carefully spoon the mixture into the prepared souffle dishes, trying to avoid getting the
mixture on the sides. Smooth the top of the mixture in the souffles.
