# Stovetop Rice

- X cups long grain rice
- X cups plus 1/2 cup water

Example: if you want to make 3 cups of rice, you use 3 1/2 cups of water.

## Pre-cooking Instructions

Rinse rice thoroughly by putting it in a bowl or pot, filling the bowl with water, and agitating the rice with a whisk 
or your hands. Then drain the rice. Repeat until the water is mostly clear after agitation, 3-5 times. Drain the rice thoroughly.

## Cooking Instructions

Put the rice and measured water into a lidded pot and put over high heat. Wait until the mixture comes to a vigerous boil 
then put the lid on the pot and reduce heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE LID.

Remove from heat after 15 minutes and let rest for another 15 minutes. DO NOT OPEN THE LID.

Fluff with a fork and serve.
