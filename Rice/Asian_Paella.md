# Asian-style Paella

This is a pared down version of one of my favorite comfort foods, [Saucy Porka's](https://saucyporka.com) Asian-style Paella. 
You can find their full recipe for the dish [here](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/asian-style-paella-5381310).

What's different? I tried to make this with things I frequently have on hand in a very short amount of time (roughly 30 minutes). 
Instead of Chinese lap cheong sausage, I fancied up some plain old breakfast sausage links. Instead of cooking a whole pork butt,
I used leftover pulled pork that I individually wrapped and froze. Instead of cooking rice from scratch, I used leftover rice
from yesterday's dinner, in the style of a fried rice. I skipped the safrito and just sauteed some aromatics quickly in oil.

Is this as good as the original? I don't think so. But given that I can crank it out in 30 minutes with stuff in the fridge,
it gets me 90% of the way there, and delivers a delishious meal, I think this recipe is a keeper.

Also, I added radish. Because radishes are good.

Serves 2

## Ingredients

For sausage:
* 4 links breakfast sausage, cooked and sliced into rounds
* Couple of pinches of [sazon con azafran](../Rubs_and_Marinades/Sazon_con_Azafran.md)
* 1 Tsp mirin or water
* 1/2 Tsp Sriracha or hot sauce
* 1/2 Tsp sugar

For paella:
* 2 Tbsp oil (bacon fat is a great, flavorful sub here)
* 4 Scallions, whites minced, greens sliced thin
* 10-15 Stalks cilantro, leafs picked and ripped, stems minced
* 1 Clove garlic, minced
* 1 Tsp [sazon con azafran](../Rubs_and_Marinades/Sazon_con_Azafran.md)
* 3 Cups leftover long grain rice
* 1 cup coconut milk
* 1 radish, sliced
* 1 portion of pulled pork, warmed through (you have this in your freezer, right? ðŸ˜‰)


## Cook the sausage

Combine sausage rounds, sazon con azafran, mirin, sriracha, and sugar and toss to coat. In a small pan over medium high
heat, cook the sausage until very well carmalized and a little charred. Set aside.

## Cook the rice

In a large pan (not non-stick) over medium heat, add the oil, scallion whites, cilantro stems, and garlic. Season with
a couple of generous pinches of salt. Sautee for just a few minutes, until aromatics are soften and scallions become 
translucent. Add the sazon con azafran and stir to combine, let cook for a minute until very fragrant.

Add the coconut milk and stir until well combined. Turn heat to high and bring mixture to a fast simmer. Simmer until
reduced by about a third. Add rice, breaking up clumps and stirring until every grain is coated. Turn heat down to 
medium-high and allow the mixture to cook without stirring for 2-3 minutes. Using a metal spatula, scrape up rice from the
bottom of the pan and mix to combine well. Repeat cooking, scraping, and mixing once more, then turn heat off.

Season to taste with salt and pepper.

## Put it together

Add the radishes, half the scallion greens, cooked sausage, and pulled pork to the pan and give everything a big stir
to distribute. Plate the paella, sprinkling scallion greens and cilantro leaves over the top.
