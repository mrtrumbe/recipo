# Golden Rice

## Ingredients

* 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
* 1/2 Tsp Turmeric
* 1/4 Tsp Cumin
* 1/4 Tsp of [Halal Cart Spice Mix](../Rubs_and_Marinades/Halal_Cart_Spice_Mix.md)
* 1 1/2 Cups Basmati Rice
* 2 1/2 Cups Low Sodium Chicken Stock

## Instructions

Rinse the rice several times until the water runs clear. Drain the rice thoroughly 
and set aside.

In a sauce pan with a cover, melt the butter over medium heat. As soon as the 
butter is melted, add the turmeric, cumin, and spice mix and cook until fragrant, 
about 30 seconds.  Add the rice and turn the heat to medium high. Stirring 
frequently, cook the rice until it smells nutty and the rice grains turn white. Add 
the chicken stock, increase the heat to high, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture 
to a boil.

Cover the mixture, then turn down the heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes. Remove 
from heat and let rest for another 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
