# Buttermilk Pancakes

## Ingredients

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp table salt
* 2 eggs
* 4 tbsp granulated sugar
* 4 tbsp melted butter
* 1 1/2 cups buttermilk
* 1/2 cup whole milk

## Instructions

Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.

In a separate bowl, whisk eggs until loose. Add sugar and whisk until 
mixture lightens in color considerably. While whisking drizzle butter into
mixture until incorporated. Add buttermilk and milk and whisk until fully
combined.

Dry and wet mixtures can be prepared separately up to a couple of hours 
ahead of time, then mixed just before making the pancakes.

Mix wet ingredients into dry ingredients and whisk just until combined. Let 
batter sit for 10 minutes before making pacakes.

Cook pancakes on a well-buttered griddle over medium heat. One flip will do.
