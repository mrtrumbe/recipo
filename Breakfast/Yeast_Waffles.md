To simplify this even further, don't separate the eggs, instead adding them whole when the
recipe  calls for egg yolks.  The waffles won't be quite as crispy and tender without the
whipped egg  whites.


## Ingredients

* 1 2/3 cups of whole milk (low or no fat can be substituted)
* 8 tbsp butter
* 2 large eggs
* 10 oz of all-purpose flour (about 2-1/4 cups)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 tsp instant yeast
* 1 tbsp of sugar
* 1/8 tsp cream of tartar
* 1 tsp vanilla or almond extract


## Ingredient Prep

Melt the butter and then set aside to cool slightly.  Bring milk to room temperature or warm
slightly on the stove.  Milk shouldn't be more than luke warm.

Separate eggs and reserve egg whites in an air tight container until ready to prepare waffles.

Mix flour, salt and instant yeast and set aside.


## Make the Batter

In a large, stable mixing bowl, beat egg yolks with a whisk until they lighten in color.  Add
sugar and beat until well combined.  Slowly drizzle melted butter into the eggs, beating
constantly.  Slowly pour milk into the mixture, beating constantly.

With a large spoon or spatula, stir in the flour mixture in three batches.  Mix until all of
the lumps are gone then scrape down the sides of the bowl.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap
and store in refrigerator for at least several hours, up to 24 hours.


## Make the Waffles

Remove the batter from the refrigerator about 10 minutes before you want to start making the
waffles.

In a medium bowl or mixer, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until they reach stiff peaks.
Set aside.

Turn your waffle iron on and set it to its hottest settings.

Give the batter a good stir with a spatula to loosen it.  Stir in vanilla extract.  With a
folding motion, incorporate whipped egg whites into the batter in three equal batches.

When the waffle iron is hot, add just enough batter to cover half of the total grill surface
before shutting the iron.  You'll have to experiment to get it right, but better to use too
little batter than too much.  Cook until your waffle iron tells you it is done.

Waffles should be eaten immediately, but can be kept on a wire rack and toasted at a high
temperature to re-warm.  They also freeze well and can be re-heated in a high oven or toaster oven.
