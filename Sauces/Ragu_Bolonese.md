# Ragu Bolognese

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp butter
* 3/4 lb ground chuck
* 3/4 lb ground pork
* 3/4 lb ground veal
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 1 large carrot, finely chopped
* 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
* 6 oz. pancetta, finely chopped
* 1 x 6 oz. can of tomato paste
* 2 tbsp sage, finely chopped
* 1 tbsp rosemary, finely chopped
* 2 1/2 cups dry red wine (dry white will also work)
* 1 x 8 oz. can of tomato sauce
* 4 cups chicken stock (see note in recipe)
* 6 oz. chicken livers, cleaned and pureed (about 4 whole)
* salt
* black pepper


## Ingredient Prep

Make sure to chop all vegetables and herbs finely to achieve the desired final consistency.

Put the chicken stock in a sauce pan and warm over medium low heat. If you aren’t using
homemade stock and are using store bought chicken broth, you should be sure to use low
sodium broth.  Also, as the gelatin in homemade stock adds to the consistency of the final
sauce, augment the chicken stock with a packet of unflavored gelatin.  Add the gelatin to
the broth once it is warm.

For chicken livers, once they have been cleaned of any stringy bits, chop them finely and
then crush them into a puree with the side of your knife.  Or, simply put them in a food
processor or blender and puree.


## Get Cooking

Heat a large dutch oven over medium high heat.  Brown the ground meat using a bit of the
butter to lubricate the dutch oven, but do it in stages.  Before each stage, make sure the
dutch oven is piping hot, then add the butter, then add just enough meat to sparsely cover
the bottom of the pan.  Once a batch is done, remove it from the pan to a bowl and then
proceed with the next batch.  If the bottom of your pan becomes too dark, de-glaze with a
bit of water (reserving the water for later addition).  Set the browned ground meat aside.

Turn the heat to medium low and add the remaining butter and onions, carrot and celery.
Gently saute until the vegetables are translucent.  Add the pancetta, sage and rosemary
and saute until pancetta is translucent.  Add tomato paste and saute for 2 minutes.

Add the ground meat back to the pan, then add the tomato sauce, wine, any liquid from the
browning step and 1 cup of the chicken stock.  Bring to a strong simmer over heat high,
then reduce heat until you achieve a very gentle simmer.

Continue gently simmering until the liquid reduces and the sauce becomes very thick.  This
will take approximately 45 minutes to an hour.  Add another cup of the chicken stock, bring
the mixture to a strong simmer over high heat, then reduce heat until you achieve a very
gentle simmer.  Reduce the sauce again until it is quite thick. Reducing a second or third
time won’t take as long as the first, as there is less liquid in the pot. Keep repeating
this process until you run out of chicken stock.


## Finishing the Sauce

Once the last of the chicken stock has been reduced and the sauce has reached the desired
consistency, turn the heat to high, add the pureed chicken livers and stir until the sauce
comes to a strong boil.  Shut off the heat.

Adjust the seasoning of the sauce with salt, pepper and a shot of wine if the sauce needs
a bit of acidity.
