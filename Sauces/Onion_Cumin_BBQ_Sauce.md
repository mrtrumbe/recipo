# Onion and Cumin BBQ Sauce

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 tbsp whole cumin seeds
* 1/2 tsp whole corriander seeds
* 2 large onions, chopped
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 2 cups water, brought to a boil
* 1/16 tsp baking soda
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp chile powder
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/4 cup bourbon (optional)
* 2 tbsp malt vinegar
* 2 tbsp packed dark brown sugar
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp hot sauce (optional)


## Instructions

In a large saucepan, add oil, cumin seeds, and corriander seeds and place 
over medium/high heat. Cook until seeds are very fragrant. Add chopped onion
and salt and stir to combine. Cook the onions over medium/high heat, stirring
and scraping up brown bits every few minutes. It will take a while for the
browning to begin and don't stir too often or it'll deter browning. You want
the onions to be very browned and translucent. You don't want to burn them, 
but they can take more browning than you might think. If in doubt, go darker.

When the onions are sufficiently brown, add 1/2 cup of the boiling hot water
and stir vigorously until all the brown bits are off the sides and bottom of
the pan. Continue cooking over medium high heat, stirring occasionally,  until 
all the water has evaporated and the onions begin browning again. Repeat the
browning process, again getting very dark, before adding another 1/2 cup of 
boiling water and the baking soda. Stir vigorously and get up the brown bits.
Again continue cooking until all of the water has evaporated. The onions
should be very brown and quite mushy.

Add tomato paste, chile powder, black pepper, and ground cumin. Cook on 
medium/high heat until the tomato paste has cooked a bit and doesn't smell
raw anymore, 3-4 minutes. If using bourbon, turn off heat and add bourbon 
to the pan. Light bourbon with a long match and let it burn off. Turn heat
back to medium/high. Cook until liquid is mostly evaporated. Add 1 cup of 
boiling water, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, and hot sauce (if using).
Bring mixture to a strong simmer, stirring frequently, then turn he heat down
to low and simmer until mixture reduces and thickens.

Put mixture into a fine seive over a large bowl. Push liquid and as many solids
as possible through the seive. Sample sauce and adjust with salt, pepper,
and vinegar as necessary. Put into a bottle or container and cool before 
serving.
