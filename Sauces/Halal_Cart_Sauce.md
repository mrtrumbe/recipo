#Halal Cart Sauce

## Ingredients

* 1 Cup Greek Yogurt (full fat is best, but low fat works)
* 1 Cup Mayo (low fat works here too)
* 1 Tbsp White Wine Vinegar
* Juice of one lemon
* 1 Tbsp neutral oil
* 1 Tsp of [halal cart spice mix](../Rubs_and_Marinades/Halal_Cart_Spice_Mix.md)
* Pinch of Turmeric


## Instructions

In a small sauce or frying pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the spice mix 
and turmeric and cook for 30 seconds. Remove from heat.

Add all the ingredients into a bowl and whisk until combined. Add cold water until 
you reach the desired consistency. Sauce should run off of a spoon in a constant 
stream.

Add vinegar, salt, pepper, and sugar to taste.
