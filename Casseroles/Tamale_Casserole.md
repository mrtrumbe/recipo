## Get Ingredients

Everything for this recipe should be available at your local supermarket. The masa
harina and corn husks might be a little hard to find, but most supermarkets will
have them.

For chicken, almost any leftovers will suffice. Just make sure it isn’t smothered
in a bold sauce and doesn’t have spices that would directly compete with mexican
flavors (like an asian rub, for instance). We frequently have roast or barbecued
chicken around and those work perfectly. Simply remove any skin, sinew, and bone
then shred.

If you don’t have pre-cooked chicken around, you can use an equivalent amount of
raw chicken, cook it mostly through on the stove top or under a broiler and cut it
up. It will fully cook in the sauce and in the casserole.

For spices, I always prefer whole spices which I roast and grind myself. But use
pre-ground to save time.


## Ingredients

Spice mixture:

* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp chile powder
* 1/4 tsp ground coriander
* 1/4 tsp dried oregano (mexican, if you can find it)
* 2 pinches of ground cinnamon

Sauce:

* 2 poblano peppers, cleaned of ribs and julienned
* 1 red pepper, cleaned of ribs and julienned
* 1 onion, julienned
* 3 cloves garlic, sliced thin
* 1 lime, rolled and cut in half
* 1 28 oz can whole tomatoes in juice/sauce
* 2 tsp tomato paste
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt
* 2/3 of the spice mixture
* 2/3 cup chicken broth (or water)

Masa:

* 2 cups masa harina (corn flour)
* 2 cups chicken broth (or water)
* 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels
* 2/3 cup lard (or equal parts cooled melted butter and vegetable oil; for a low fat
    version, cut this in half and compensate with extra stock or water)
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp table salt

Finishing Ingredients:

* 6-8 corn husks (optional), soaked in water for 30 minutes
* 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (mexican mix from the grocery also works well)
* 1/3 of the spice mixture


## Get Cooking

Start by mixing the spices together in a small bowl.  Set aside.

Next, make the sauce. Separate the tomato solids from the juice using a strainer,
keeping the juices in a bowl. Use your hands to break up the tomatoes so all the
juices go through the strainer. Remove the big tomato pieces from the strainer onto
a cutting board. Then use a spoon to push as much of the remaining tomato mixture
through, leaving only the seeds in the strainer. Discard seeds. Roughly chop the
tomatoes on the cutting board and add back to the juice.

In a large frying pan over medium high heat, get the vegetable oil hot. Add the
onions and a third of the salt and fry until slightly brown and limp. If the onions
get too brown, add a little water to cool them off and clean the pan. Next add the
peppers and cook until they start to brown. Turn down the heat to medium and add the
garlic, two-thirds of the spice mixture and the tomato paste to the pan. Cook over
medium heat for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add the tomatoes, chicken stock and the rest of the salt to the vegetables and raise
the heat to medium high. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium. Cook at a strong
simmer for about 10-15 minutes until much of the liquid has boiled away and the color
is a deep red.

Add the chicken and squeeze the juice from the limes into the mixture.  Cook until
the chicken is heated through. If the mixture is too dry, add some water to loosen.
You want the sauce slightly more loose than it will be when you serve it because it
will be cooked again. Taste the sauce and add salt, sugar and vinegar as desired. Set
aside to cool.

Finally, the masa. In a small pan over medium-high heat, cook the corn in 2 tbsp of
the lard or fat until well cooked through. Take of heat and using a fork, mash it into
a paste like consistency. Let it cool thoroughly.

Mix the masa harina, salt, baking powder, chicken stock (or water), corn mixture and
fat in a large bowl. Initially the mixture will seem too loose, but let it sit for a minute and the masa harina will absorb most of the moister and the mixture will become thick, yet still loose. Add extra water or masa harina as necessary to get the perfect consistency. The desired consistency isn’t isn’t quite a liquid and isn’t quite a solid, but somewhere in between.


## Putting It All Together

Coat a 9x13” casserole dish with a little oil or cooking spray. If using corn husks,
line the bottom and sides of the dish with the soaked husks. It’s ok if there are
gaps in between the husks, but try to cover as much of the surface of the dish as
possible.

Carefully spoon the masa mixture on top of the corn husks and use a large spoon to
even out the masa. Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture over the masa mixture. Next,
carefully spoon the sauce over the top of the masa and spread it around evenly.
Finally, sprinkle the cheese over the top of the casserole.

The casserole can be refrigerated for up to 5 days before cooking, if stored in the
refrigerator covered with saran wrap. Take the casserole out of the fridge about a
half hour before cooking to let the casserole dish warm up a bit before putting it
in the oven.

Pre-heat the oven to 375F.

Cover the casserole in aluminum foil. Bake on the middle shelf for 30 minutes. Remove
foil and bake for another 30 minutes until the casserole is bubbly and the cheese
is browning. Let cool 15 minutes before slicing and eating.


## Enhancements

I like to use bacon fat for part of the fat that goes into the masa mixture. It adds
a nice smoky tone to the masa.

This recipe isn’t spicy at all. To add a little kick and some nice smokiness to the
dish, add one or two adobo-packed chipotle peppers to the sauce. Remove their seeds
and chop them finely, then add them when you add the tomato paste to the sauce. In
a pinch, some red pepper flakes, hot sauce or cayenne pepper also works to spice up
the dish.
