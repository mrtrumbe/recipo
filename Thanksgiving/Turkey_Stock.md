# Turkey Stock

- 4 lbs turkey wings
- 2 onions, roughly chopped
- 4 carrots, roughly chopped
- 4 celery ribs, roughly chopped
- 8 cloves of garlic, crushed
- 1 bunch of thyme
- 1 bunch of sage
- 1 bunch of thyme
- 10 whole peppercorns
- 1 bay leaf

Preheat the oven to 400° F.

Place the turkey wings on a sheet pan and bake until golden brown, turning as they cook to ensure even browning. 
Wings don’t need to be cooked through, just browned. 

Remove wings from the pan and put into a large stock pot. Drain any grease from the pan (save it for cooking!), 
then add boiling water to the pan and scrape off any brown bits off the bottom. Pour the water and any bits into 
the stock pot.

Add the rest of the ingredients to the stock pot, then add enough cold water to fully submerge all of the 
ingredients, about 1 gallon or 4 quarts. The amount of water you need will depend on the amount of ingredients 
and shape of your pot.

Bring the pot to a simmer over low heat. Let simmer for about 2 hours, checking occasionally to ensure the mixture 
stays at a low simmer. Strain through a fine mesh strainer and let cool for at least 30 minutes. Transfer to containers 
and put into the refrigerator to cool completely, about 8 hours.
