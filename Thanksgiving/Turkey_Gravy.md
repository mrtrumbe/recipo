# Turkey Gravy

- Turkey trimmings (neck, gizzards, organs, backbone if you spatchcocked your bird, etc) roughly cut into smaller pieces *
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 1 carrots, roughly chopped
- 2 ribs celery, roughly chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 2 sprigs thyme
- 1 sprig sage
- 1 bay leaves
- 1 1/2 quarts (6 cups) low sodium chicken or turkey stock *
- 2 tbsp whiskey or brandy (optional)
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 3 tbsp butter
- 1 1/2 ounce flour (about 4 tbsp)

*Note on turkey trimmings: these are optional, but will give you a deep turkey flavor you won’t be able to get without them.*
*You are going to get the trimmings when you buy a turkey, so you may as well use them. If you are making gravy for other purposes,*
*you are fine omitting them.*

*Note on stock: if using store bought stock, heat up some of the stock in a saucepan and add 1 packet of unflavored gelatin to it,*
*stirring until dissolved. Then add the stock and gelatin mixture back to the rest of the stock.*

If using turkey trimmings, brown them in a dutch oven or large pot over medium high heat. If you have turkey fat, use that for an oil. 
If not, use a little neutral oil. Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Set trimmings and liquid aside and wipe out the pot.

Add some neutral oil to the pot and then add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic. Sauté over medium high heat until vegetables are browned, 
about 10 minutes. Add stock, herbs, and soy sauce. Add whiskey if using. If using turkey trimmings, add them and the liquid, or add the 
wine now if you aren’t using turkey trimmings. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Simmer for 1 hour, then strain 
the mixture through a fine mesh strainer.  You should have 1 quart (4 cups) of liquid. If you don’t have four cups, add more stock or 
water. If you have too much liquid, only use 4 cups.

In a large sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk it into the butter, then continue to cook and whisk 
continuously until the flour loses it’s “raw” smell and starts to smell nutty and the mixture starts to darken. While continuing to whisk 
continuously, add the strained liquid a little at a time, allowing each batch of liquid to incorporate before adding more. The mixture 
will be clumpy at first, but as you add more liquid and the mixture heats up, it will loosen and become more smooth. Once all the liquid 
has been added, let the mixture come to a boil, then reduce the heat to reach a simmer. Simmer until the mixture thickens and reduces to 
about 3 cups. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

Gravy can be made several days ahead of time and kept in the refrigerator until ready to use.
