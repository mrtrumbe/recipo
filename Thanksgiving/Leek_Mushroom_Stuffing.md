# Leek and Mushroom Stuffing

- 1 loaf fresh Italian bread, cut into 3/4” cubes \*
- 2 pounds shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, sliced into 1/4” strips \*
- 1/2 ounce dried porcini mushrooms
- 2 large leeks
- 1 cup unsalted butter (2 sticks)
- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups white wine
- 1/2 tablespoon thyme, minced
- 1/4 cup of sage, cut into thin ribbons
- 1 egg
- Up to 1 quart of low sodium chicken or turkey stock \*

*Note on bread: the texture of the bread will make a big difference in the final texture of the stuffing.*
*If you use a very chewy bread, your stuffing will end up more tough. If you use a very pillowy bread with*
*a very open crumb and lots of air bubbles, your stuffing will be very light and may even fall apart. I go*
*for something in between.*

*Note on shiitake: you can use almost any mushroom in this recipe. Shiitakes are a favorite, but brown or*
*white button, portabella, hen of the woods, oyster, or any other type can be used. The key is to ensure*
*you cut the mushroom into pieces that are just a bit smaller than the bread pieces, so if you use a large*
*mushroom, you need to cut it into smaller pieces.*

*Note on stock: if using store bought stock, heat up some of the stock in a saucepan and add 1 packet of*
*unflavored gelatin to it, stirring until dissolved. Then add the stock and gelatin mixture back to the*
*rest of the stock.*

Put the bread cubes on a large sheet pan or two and place into a 250° F oven for about an hour. The bread 
should completely dry out, but not brown. Remove from the oven and let cool.

Process the porcini by putting them into a bowl and pouring 1 1/2 cups boiling water over them. Let them 
soak for 30 minutes. Pour off 1 cup of the water and reserve, being careful not to use any sediment in the 
bottom of the bowl. Then remove the porcinis from the water and slice into 1/4” strips.

Process the leeks by removing the dark green parts and roots, then cut them in half lengthwise before cutting 
into 1/2” pieces. Put the pieces in a large bowl and then fill with water and agitate the leeks. Remove the 
leeks to a colander, leaving any sediment in the bottom of the bowl and discarding.

Sauté the mushrooms in a neutral oil over medium high heat. Work in batches so that the mushrooms don’t get 
water logged and brown properly. Move mushrooms to the side for later use.

In a large pan, melt the butter over medium heat. When butter is melted add the leaks and the garlic and 
gently sauté until translucent. Add the thyme and black pepper and sauté until fragrant. Add the wine and 
the reserved porcini water and simmer until most of the liquid has reduced, 10-15 minutes. Add all of the 
mushrooms and the sage, stir until well combined and remove from heat. Taste the mixture and add salt and 
pepper until the mixture is over-seasoned (this mixture should be a little too salty as it needs to season 
the bread as well, but don’t overdo it!).

*\[At this point the recipe can be paused until you are ready to bake the stuffing. Put the bread cubes in*
*a tupperware or plastic bag and leave out at room temperature. Put the butter/mushroom/leek mixture in a* 
*tupperware or bowl in the fridge until ready to use. This can be done a day or two ahead of time.\]*

Combine the bread and butter/mushroom/leek mixture in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Start adding stock a 
little at a time, letting the stock soak into the bread while mixing. Because the bread is dry, it will take 
a little time for each batch of stock to soak into the bread. Keep adding stock until the bread stops 
absorbing more stock and the mixture looks a little too wet. Beat the egg in a separate bowl until it 
lightens in color, then add it to the bread mixture and mix thoroughly to combine.

To bake, preheat the oven to 375° F. Grease a 9x13” casserole dish with butter or cooking spray. Add the 
bread mixture and spread evenly in the dish. Bake uncovered until heated through and brown on top, about 
45 minutes.
